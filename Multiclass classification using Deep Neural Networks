Key points from Assignment No: 2B:

1. **Multiclass classification**:
   - Sorting data into three or more categories instead of just two (binary classification).
   - Used in various fields like image classification, text classification, disease diagnosis, etc.
  
2. **Example of Multiclass Classification**:
   - Image classification: Sorting images into multiple categories like cats, dogs, birds.
   - Text classification: Sorting text documents into categories like politics, sports, entertainment.
   - Disease diagnosis: Classifying patients into disease categories like diabetes, cancer, heart disease.
   
3. **How Deep Neural Networks Work on Multiclass Classification**:
   - Using neural networks to learn patterns and features from data to classify them into multiple classes.
   - Model architecture typically consists of input, hidden, and output layers.
   - Activation functions like softmax are used in the output layer for multiclass classification.
   
4. **Code Explanation with Output**:
   - Loading OCR letter recognition dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Preprocessing data, reshaping images, and normalizing pixel values.
   - Defining a neural network model using Keras Sequential API.
   - Compiling the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
   - Training the model on training data and evaluating its performance on test data.
   - Important concepts covered in the code include batch size, dropout, RMSprop optimizer, softmax function, and ReLU function.
